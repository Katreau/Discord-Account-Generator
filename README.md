# Discord Account Generator
This script is designed to generate Discord accounts automatically. It uses a set of predefined parameters to create accounts with random usernames, emails, and passwords. The script does not require an API key for solving captchas, as it handles captcha solving internally. Please note that using this script may violate Discord's Terms of Service, and you should proceed with caution and responsibility.

For start the script, please start the <code>install.bat</code> OR do <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> and do <code>python script.py</code>
